# Alzheimer's Disease Dataset

## Background
2,149 patients, whose IDs range from 4751 to 6900, have comprehensive health information in this dataset. The dataset contains information on clinical measures, medical history, lifestyle variables, cognitive and functional evaluations, symptoms, and an Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. Researchers and data scientists wishing to investigate risk factors for Alzheimer's, create prediction models, and do statistical analysis will find the data to be excellent.

## Dataset
This dataset can be find on Kaggle from the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/alzheimers-disease-dataset?resource=download.

## NeuralNetwork 
Artificial neural networks are parametric machine learning algorithms that try to mimic the way information is processed in the brain. The idea of this project to predict the columns that say diagnosis.
